# Informatik_ass2
2nd assignment of info course - working with real data

### Explaination for Paula:
- [Recomendation only] Look at the 4th cell of assignment2.ipynb "Plot functions" first
and follow the functions which get called and look them up in cell 3 "functions". I hope it makes sense.
- To try on your own and observe and use the functions please make a copy of "assignment2.ipynb" and
give it a different name. Work in that new file and only(!) update the main file "assignment2.ipynb" after
  (1.) you tested the changes well and after (2.) you made sure that your changes improve the main file
or (in case of editing existing functions) that they work better than the existing one's.
- Have fun and enjoy :D!
