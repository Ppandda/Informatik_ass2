# Informatik_ass2
2nd assignment of info course - working with real data

### Explaination for Paula:
- [Recomendation only] Look at the 4th cell of assignment2.ipynb "Plot functions" first
and follow the functions which get called and look them up in cell 3 "functions". I hope it makes sense.
- To try on your own and observe and use the functions please make a copy of "assignment2.ipynb" and
give it a different name. Work in that new file and only(!) update the main file "assignment2.ipynb" after
  (1.) you tested the changes well and after (2.) you made sure that your changes improve the main file
or (in case of editing existing functions) that they work better than the existing one's.
- Have fun and enjoy :D!
- (testreport also attached, for looking up potential errors or missing cases)

## Design - functions
Read data from a .csv (2 csv's) from a country (3 countries) into dataframe and plot it (them).

**required functions and open tasks**:
- [x] read data from a .csv to a dataframe
- [x] bring country names from alpha3 to fullname for the plot describtion
- [x] **[in file burns1: 18]** 'load_oecd_csv_to_df_alpha3(file_path, *chosen_countries)' all countries to df
- [ ] axis description and title of scatterplots
- [ ] different colors for countries in scatterplots ('LOCATION' as column additionally to index)

**open plots**:
- [ ] make lineplot of 3 datasets
  - [x] first plot
  - [x] second plot
  - [ ] third plot
- [ ] make barplot of 3 datasets
  - [x] first plot
  - [ ] second plot
  - [ ] third plot
- [ ] make scatterplot of 3x2 datasets
  - [x] first plot
  - [ ] second plot
  - [ ] third plot
- [ ] 3 EXTRA points if everything ready and still time and motivation
  - [ ] 1-2 extra line plot(s)
  - [ ] 1-2 extra bar plot(s)
  - [ ] 1-2 extra scatter plot(s)
